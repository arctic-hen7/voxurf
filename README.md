# Voxurf

Voxurf is a simple web extension and Wasm-based Rust library that lets users speak and have their utternace decoded into a series of actions executed in any website, allowing you to use your voice to control the web.

This is a hackathon project, and is probably awful for now!

**Dear judges, this branch contains additional, post-hackathon work! Please judge the `main` branch, not this one!**
